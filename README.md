## Brutal Damage Game Clock

This is the chess clock app that we use during our weekly live streams to display the game clock on the stream.

<b>Warning:</b> this code is in a pretty rough state at this point, its mostly in a POC category. The repo it was forked from is quite old (8+ years), so its defintiely not up on standards yet. But it was adequate as a starting point for what we needed and what I ([Drew](https://github.com/keannan5390)) could throw together in about 6 hours. We'll work on updating, enhancing and making it modern as the weeks and months progress. So, bear with us if you care to borrow the code.

The source is forked from [https://github.com/japtar10101/Chess-Clock-App](https://github.com/japtar10101/Chess-Clock-App). It has then been modified to support tracking control points for Warmachine & Hordes.

Additional changes include adding support for [Nanohttpd](https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd) to create a webpage & websocket server so the game info can be viewed in a web browser. it is ulimately intended to be viewed in some form of a camera/live streaming utility application.
